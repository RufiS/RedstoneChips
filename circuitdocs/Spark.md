Fires a lightning bolt over an interface block. The chip can have any number of input and interface block pairs. When one of the inputs is triggered, a lightning will fire over the corresponding interface block. 

When adding __'bin'__ as a sign argument, it is possible to set an interface block to fire by setting the chips data pins (inputs 2 and above) to the desired binary number and then triggering the 1st input pin.

Use __'fake'__ as a sign argument to prevent the lightning bolt from causing actual damage.

#### I/O setup 
* The same number of input pins and interface blocks.
* In bin (binary) mode 1st input triggers the chip while the rest determine the interface block to fire.
